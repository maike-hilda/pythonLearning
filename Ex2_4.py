#Exercise 2.4
#Assume we execute the following assignment statements:
width = 17
height = 12.0
#For each of the following expressions, write the value of the
#expression and the type (of the value of the expression)
a = width/2 #should be 8 (the floor, in python version < 3.0)
print a
b = width/2.0 #should be 8.5
print b
c = height/3 #should be 4.0
print c
d = 1 + 2 * 5 #should be 11
print d
